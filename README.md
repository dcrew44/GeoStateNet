A deep learning model that achieves **76.66% accuracy** in predicting US states from street view images. This project demonstrates advanced computer vision techniques applied to geographical feature recognition. 


## üéØ Project Overview

GeoStateNet is a fine-tuned ResNet-101 model with a custom head, trained on the 50States10K dataset to classify which US state a street view image was taken in. Developed as my senior project at the University of Redlands, this project explores how deep learning can recognize subtle geographical patterns in visual data.

### Key Features
- **76.66% panorama accuracy** - Significantly outperforming the original DeepGeo baseline (38.32%)
- **Real-time inference** - Integrated with GeoGuessr game via Chrome extension
- **Comprehensive training pipeline** - Multi-phase training with Weights & Biases integration
- **Practical Implementation** - Includes API server and browser extension for practical applications

## üèÜ Results

| Model | Panorama Accuracy | Single Image Accuracy | 
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| DeepGeo (baseline) | 38.32% | 25.92% |
| **GeoStateNet** | **76.66%** | **60.82%** |

### Training Metrics (via Weights & Biases)
- Final validation loss: 1.34
- Best epoch: 4/5
- Training conducted on Google Colab with NVIDIA A100 GPU

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the 50States10K and 50States2K datasets from the DeepGeo paper:

- **Training**: 500K images (2.5K locations √ó 4 views √ó 50 states)
- **Testing**: 100K images (500 locations √ó 4 views √ó 50 states)
- **Resolution**: 256√ó256 pixels
- **Coverage**: All 50 US states with stratified sampling

### Obtaining the Dataset

1. Download from the DeepGeo project:
   - [50States10K (Training)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8eqx1Uy8kuRP4BNmTCVvrNbCxx6RoiP/view)
   - [50States2K (Test)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zHc3wcQxicoij0tGHBpVSKqN_QgZsF-t/view)

2. Extract to the `data/` directory following the structure in the repository


**Licence note:** The 50States10K/2K datasets are released by the DeepGeo authors without an explicit licence. Redistribution here is limited to download links; users should cite the original paper when using the data.


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

GeoStateNet employs a sophisticated training strategy:

1. **Base Model**: ResNet-101 pretrained on ImageNet
2. **Custom Head**: AdaptiveConcatPool2d + Fully Connected layers with dropout
3. **Multi-Phase Training**:
   - Phase 1: Head-only training 
   - Phase 2: Unfreeze Layer 4 
   - Phase 3: Unfreeze Layers 2-4 
4. **Panorama Aggregation during Inference**: Averages predictions across 4 cardinal directions
